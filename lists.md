   You can have properly indented paragraphs

   To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.  
   Note that this line is seperate, but within the same paragraph.  
   (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
